# The Real PDX OG 🌿

Welcome to *The Real PDX OG* — Portland’s unapologetic cannabis review blog. This project is a personal exploration of Oregon’s cannabis culture, built to spotlight the strains, growers, and dispensaries that keep it real.

## 🔥 What This Is

A static site built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, hosted on GitHub Pages. It features:

- 🌬️ **Strain Reviews** — Taste, smell, expansion, and emotional impact
- 🌱 **Grower Spotlights** — Who grew it, where, and when
- 🏪 **Dispensary Picks** — Weekly shoutouts to shops with standout drops
- 🧠 **Personal Reflections** — My experience, my vibe, my truth

## 🎯 Why It Exists

Cannabis is more than a product — it’s a culture, a craft, and a connection. This blog is my way of honoring that, while building a portfolio that blends storytelling, sensory analysis, and digital design.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5 / CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript
- GitHub Pages for hosting
