  <h2>🔥 About The Real PDX OG</h2>

  <p>
    Here at <strong>The Real PDX OG</strong>, we’ve got a dedicated crew of seasoned smokers who live for the experience—and 
    we’re here to deliver the <strong>realest, rawest cannabis reviews</strong> you’ll find in today’s dispensaries.
  </p>

  <p>
    We don’t hold back. Every review is built on honesty, not hype. You might not always agree with us (<em>what works for one person 
        might flop for another</em>), and that’s okay—we give you the chance to speak up. Every strain comes with a vote: 
        <strong>Agree or Disagree</strong>, so your voice helps shape the community.
  </p>

  <p>
    We’re here to share our wisdom and lived experience. But remember: cannabis is complex. Not all plants are equal. Even clones can 
    vary wildly depending on how they’re grown. Conditions shift, batches change, and the final product can surprise you—for better or 
    worse.
  </p>

  <p>
    That’s why we track the details that matter: <strong>harvest dates, growers, producers, dispensaries</strong>, and more. Our goal 
    is to spotlight consistency and quality, so you can make the most informed choices possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yes, we’re <strong>“Weed Snobs”</strong>—but it’s all about the experience. Think of it like this: you can drive across town 
    in a beat-up old car, or you can ride in a fully catered limo. Both get you there. But one makes the journey unforgettable.
  </p>

  <p>
    Great cannabis can do that. The taste, the aroma, the feeling—it’s not just about getting high. It’s about <strong>elevating 
        the ride</strong>.
  </p>
    <p>
    And if you’re wondering what sets us apart—<em>we’re the ones handing you the little pink spoon</em>. Just like that first taste at the ice cream counter, we serve up real samples of the cannabis experience. No pressure, no fluff—just a flavorful scoop of what’s good, what’s mid, and what’s straight-up legendary.
